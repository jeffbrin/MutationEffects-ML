A tab-delimited report based on each variant at a location on the genome for which data have been submitted to ClinVar.  
The data for the variant are reported for each assembly, so most variants have a line for GRCh37 (hg19) and another line for GRCh38 (hg38).
 



AlleleID               integer value as stored in the AlleleID field in ClinVar  (//Measure/@ID in the XML)
Type                   character, the type of variant represented by the AlleleID
Name                   character, ClinVar's preferred name for the record with this AlleleID
GeneID                 integer, GeneID in NCBI's Gene database, reported if there is a single gene, otherwise reported as -1.
GeneSymbol             character, comma-separated list of GeneIDs overlapping the variant
HGNC_ID                string, of format HGNC:integer, reported if there is a single GeneID. Otherwise reported as '-'
ClinicalSignificance   character, semicolon-separated list of aggregate values of germline classification calculated for this variant.
                       Because the aggregate values of germline classification gives precedence to records with assertion criteria 
                       and evidence, the values in this column may appear to be in conflict with the value reported in ClinSigSimple. 
ClinSigSimple          integer, 0 = no current value of Likely pathogenic; Pathogenic; Likely pathogenic, low penetrance;
                                    Pathogenic, low penetrance; Likely risk allele; or Risk allele
                                1 = at least one current record submitted with an interpretation of Likely pathogenic; Pathogenic;
                                    Likely pathogenic, low penetrance; Pathogenic, low penetrance; Likely risk allele; 
                                    or Risk allele (independent of whether that record includes assertion criteria and evidence).
                               -1 = no values for clinical significance at all for this variant or set of variants; used for
                                    the "included" variants that are only in ClinVar because they are included in a
                                    haplotype or genotype with an interpretation
                       NOTE: Now that the aggregate values of clinical significance give precedence to records with
                             assertion criteria and evidence, the values in this column may appear to be in conflict with the
                             value reported in ClinicalSignificance.  In other words, if a submission without assertion criteria and
                             evidence interpreted an allele as pathogenic, and those with assertion criteria and evidence interpreted
                             as benign, then ClinicalSignificance would be reported as Benign and ClinSigSimple as 1.
LastEvaluated          date, the latest "date last evaluated" on submissions with a germline classification for the variant

PhenotypeIDs           character, list of identifiers for condition(s) reported for this variant, either the condition for the
                       classification or the disease context for functional data. If there are more than one RCV in the RCVaccession
                       column, the sets of identifiers per RCV are separated by a pipe. Multiple identifiers for the same condition
                       are separated by a comma. If an RCV has more than one condition, the set of identifiers for each condition
                       are separated by a semi-colon. If an RCV has more than 5 conditions, the number of conditions is reported
                       instead all of the identifiers. 
PhenotypeList          character, list of condition names corresponding to PhenotypeIDs. If there are more than one RCV in the RCVaccession
                       column, the sets of names per RCV are separated by a pipe. If an RCV has more than one condition, the set of identifiers
                       for each condition are separated by a semi-colon. If an RCV has more than 5 conditions, the number of conditions is
                       reported instead all of the identifiers.
