Notes:


For cleaning:
- GeneID and GeneSymbol seem redundant. Remove GeneID and extract Gene with multiple symbols
- GeneName to be removed. Seems like a way to name the gene and summarizes features we already have columns for
- HGNC_ID to be removed. Says if there is more than one GeneID. Redundant
- RS# (dbSNP) to be removed. Seems like an ID for another DB. Almost all are missing
- nsv/esv (dbVar) to be removed. Same thing as ^^
- RCVaccession to be removed. Seems like redundant information Gene, ClinicalSignificance etc. 
- PhenotypeIDS and PhenotypeList seems to have a bunch of missing. ID seems to say no missing but List seems to indicate most are missing
- Origin seems like more granular than OriginSimple. Remove OriginSimple?
- Chromosome has int as dtype for some instances and str as others. Jeffrey tism this for me please.
- ReferenceAllele and AlternateAllele to be removed. Almost all missing
STOPPED AFTER Cytogenetic
